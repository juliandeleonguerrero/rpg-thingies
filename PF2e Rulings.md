# Introduction

This page exists to document various rulings made in the PF2e system for my games. As usual, the DM's word is the final one.

# Immunity to Critical Hits, and Spell Attacks

## Facts of the Case

The wording of the rule for immunity to critical hits, versus the wording of magical spell attacks are vague, and could imply there is some exception to critically hitting using magic. See the following text:

> **Source** *Player Core pg. 408* 
>
> Immunity to critical hits works a little differently. When a creature immune to critical hits is critically hit by a Strike or other attack that deals damage, it takes normal damage instead of double damage. This does not make it immune to any other critical success effects of the actions, such as a critical specialization effect or the extra damage of the deadly trait. However, in some cases the GM might determine the added effects don’t apply.

## Opinion of the Court

It is held that even if spells are not technically spelled out as making a "hit" or hitting, the intention here is almost certainly that "other attacks" applies to spell attacks.

# Spell Attacks and Critical Hits

## Facts of the Case

Additional weirdness within PF2e includes confusion on whether spell attacks critically hit. See the following information, as a spell does not "Strike" unless specified otherwise.

> **Source** *Player Core pg. 275*
>
> When you make a Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack and succeed with a natural 20 (the number on the die is 20), or if the result of your  attack exceeds the target’s AC by 10, you achieve a critical success  (also known as a critical hit). If you critically succeed at a Strike  (page 418), your attack deals double damage.

## Opinion of the Court

It is ruled that spell attacks do not produce additional critical damage by default, as they are not Strikes unless the spell specifies such. See the following text:

However, almost every spell, to every spell that is an attack does specify at least doubled damage (and perhaps other effects), rendering this judgement relatively moot.

# Nonlethal Attacks Versus Massive Damage

## Facts of the Case

Nonlethal attacks operate under the following rule:

> **Source** *Player Core pg. 407*
> You can make a nonlethal attack to knock someone out instead of killing  them (see Knocked Out and Dying on page 410). Weapons with the nonlethal trait (including fists) do this automatically. You take a –2  circumstance penalty to the attack roll when you make a nonlethal attack using a weapon or unarmed attack that doesn’t have the nonlethal trait. You also take this penalty when making a lethal attack using a  nonlethal weapon. Spells and other effects with the nonlethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points knock the creature out instead of killing them.

However, this runs into a strange potential interaction with the rules regarding massive damage, as described below:

> **Source** *Player Core pg. 412*
> You die instantly if you ever take damage equal to or greater than double your maximum Hit Points in one blow.

It must then be decided: which rule trumps which?

## Opinion of the Court

The Court acknowledges that the wording of the massive damage rule implies that it interacts outside of damage directly, which would mean that regardless of the source of damage, it results in instant death. However, the court demurs on this point, for the following three reasons:

- The rule on instant death via Massive Damage as written is for ***player characters only***. If this is the case, can nonlethal damage only kill a player character, upon Massive Damage being dealt? Such a ruling would provoke a curious exception that seems to operate outside the intentions of the PF2e system designers.

- The instant death rule regarding massive damage is a general rule, and attacks with the nonlethal trait are a more specific rule. Within PF2e system design, specific usually beats general.

- Finally, "if you ever take damage..." wording within the Massive Damage rule implies that you are taking that damage, and then you die. However, the nonlethal trait has already pre-empted this damage as not being lethal. Let us reference the Getting Knocked Out rule:

  > **Source** *Player Core pg. 410*
  >
  > Creatures can't be reduced to fewer than 0 Hit Points. When most creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they die and are removed from play unless the attack was nonlethal, in which case they're instead knocked out for a significant amount of time (usually 10 minutes or more). When undead and constructs reach 0 Hit Points, they're destroyed.

​	This implies we ignore usual rules about dying, and the creature lives.
