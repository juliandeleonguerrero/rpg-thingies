# Introduction

This page exists to document various rulings made in the PF2e system for my games. As usual, the DM's word is the final one.

# Immunity to Critical Hits, and Spell Attacks

The wording of the rule for immunity to critical hits, versus the wording of magical spell attacks are vague, and could imply there is some exception to critically hitting using magic. See the following text:

> **Source** *Player Core pg. 408* 
>
> Immunity to critical hits works a little differently. When a creature immune to critical hits is critically hit by a Strike or other attack that deals damage, it takes normal damage instead of double damage. This does not make it immune to any other critical success effects of the actions, such as a critical specialization effect or the extra damage of the deadly trait. However, in some cases the GM might determine the added effects don’t apply.

DestinyGrey has ruled that even if spells are not technically ruled to "hit", the intention here is almost certainly that "other attacks" applies to spell attacks.

# Spell Attacks and Critical Hits

DestinyGrey has ruled that spell attacks do not produce additional critical damage by default, as they are not Strikes unless the spell specifies such. See the following text:

> **Source** *Player Core pg. 275*
>
> When you make a Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack and succeed with a natural 20 (the number on the die is 20), or if the result of your  attack exceeds the target’s AC by 10, you achieve a critical success  (also known as a critical hit). If you critically succeed at a Strike  (page 418), your attack deals double damage.

However, almost every spell, to every spell that is an attack does specify at least doubled damage (and perhaps other effects), rendering this judgement relatively moot.
